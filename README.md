# AniCrawler

Here's my first completed coding project.

Just enter your desired anime name or gogoanime link and the app will try to download it in the included downloads folder, success largely depends on your internet collection.

Some features are still works in progress but the general functionality should work fine, either open the download link or download it via the app

Make sure to download requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt !

Enjoy <3
